      <h2>About Eduba</h2>
      <p>
        Eduba draws inspiration from the ancient Babylonian schools—where writing was first fostered and 
        transformed how people learned, communicated, and built their futures. Today, we carry that same 
        spirit into modern classrooms, with a focus on empowering teachers through responsible, innovative 
        technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        From developing user-friendly software that streamlines daily tasks to running hands-on “Eduba Labs” 
        that illustrate exactly when (and how) modern tools add value, we’re creating a flexible environment 
        for educators to explore, experiment, and actively shape the next wave of teaching solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vision is straightforward: give educators the support, training, and real-world tools they need 
        to spark student curiosity and navigate a rapidly changing world. By continuously refining our 
        approach in close collaboration with schools, we believe we can build a broader societal impact— 
        because when education is at the center, everyone grows and thrives together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow us as we champion a future where teaching, technology, and genuine human connection 
        intersect in the best ways possible.

      <h2>Eduba Labs & Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        Our “Eduba Labs” represent more than just training sessions—they’re collaborative spaces where 
        educators can voice their day-to-day challenges, share new ideas, and explore emerging technologies 
        firsthand. It’s not about adopting tools for the sake of it, but about shaping them to fit 
        genuine classroom needs.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Group Sessions:</strong> A supportive “therapy” environment where teachers discuss 
          current pain points with tech, compare approaches, and see live demos of evolving solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Cohort Collaboration:</strong> We collect feedback and identify trends or unique 
          ideas, refining our software in real-time to match what educators truly want.</li>
        <li><strong>Consultancy Mindset:</strong> Each educator becomes a “product development consultant,” 
          guiding us to design features and interfaces that genuinely enhance teaching and learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By placing educators at the center, Eduba Labs become a testing ground for new approaches—allowing 
        everyone to learn, adapt, and co-create the future of education.

      <h2>Explore Our Tools</h2>
      <p>
        At Eduba, we’re developing two complementary tools—two sides of the same coin—designed to 
        empower teachers and school communities to shape technology on their own terms.
      </p>
      <div class="tools-grid">
        <!-- Tool 1: Generative UI -->
        <div class="tool-card">
          <h3>Generative UI Prototype</h3>
          <p>
            A sandbox environment that lets educators experiment with cutting-edge interface concepts. 
            Here, you can tinker with potential features, customize layouts, and preview how future 
            classrooms might integrate technology. It’s a place to dream, design, and influence how 
            next-generation tools should serve real educational needs.
          </p>
          <!-- For a future link or button if you have a URL:

        </div>

        <!-- Tool 2: Collaborative Chat Interface -->
        <div class="tool-card">
          <h3>Collaborative Chat & Testing</h3>
          <p>
            A multi-user chat platform that seamlessly connects you to different model providers. 
            Perfect for real-time testing with colleagues, you can compare responses side-by-side, 
            or explore collaborative workflows. Think of it as a shared space to experiment, evaluate, 
            and refine how tech can support your teaching style.

        Both prototypes are living projects—shaped by educator feedback and evolving classroom realities. 
        Ultimately, our goal is to merge insights from these explorations into one (or multiple) 
        real-world solutions that educators can fully own and adapt to their unique contexts.
