      <h2>What is EDUBA?</h2>
      <p>
        Born from a passion for learning and inspired by the ancient schools of Babylon, EDUBA 
        exists to champion educators in a rapidly changing world. Our ethos is simple: we focus on 
        real classroom challenges and build solutions from the ground up—letting teachers, academic 
        researchers, and technologists co-create the best possible environment for students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drawing on experience that spans cryptography, avionics, brand strategy, and hands-on 
        classroom leadership, our team knows that the disruption caused by technology can be turned 
        into an opportunity. By partnering with educators, we explore and refine new ways of 
        teaching—staying agile, innovative, and always collaborative.

      <h2>Our Mission & Approach</h2>
      <p>
        EDUBA’s core mission is to <strong>empower educators</strong> to shape technology 
        rather than be shaped by it. We offer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hands-On Collaboration:</strong> Workshops and “Labs” where educators 
          guide the direction of new tools, ensuring any tech solution is tuned to real needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Research-Backed Insight:</strong> Collaborations with academic labs—like 
          ongoing work with a Neuropolitics postdoc—that help us understand how technology 
          impacts both teaching and learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive Development:</strong> We’re constantly iterating, testing, and 
          listening to feedback. Educators act as product consultants, helping us build 
          interfaces that feel natural and useful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether it’s refining how next-generation interfaces integrate into lesson planning or 
        developing platforms that let teachers explore and experiment, we believe in creating 
        technology that genuinely elevates the classroom experience.

      <h2>Reaching Educators</h2>
      <p>
        We understand educators have real concerns: time constraints, overloaded ed-tech stacks, and 
        a genuine worry about where technology fits in a student’s life. Our solution is to build 
        from their perspective:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1:1 Interviews & Group Sessions:</strong> We host face-to-face and virtual “Group 
          Therapy” discussions where teachers share pain points and discover new ways to integrate 
          tech into their workflows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Continuous Feedback Loops:</strong> Through cohort WhatsApp groups and online 
          surveys, educators become active “Product Development Consultants,” helping shape each 
          iteration of our solutions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Live Demos & Events:</strong> Held at dedicated “Futures Institutes,” these events 
          allow educators to network, test prototypes, and co-create improvements.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By centering education in every conversation, we help teachers see not just what’s possible 
        with emerging technology, but how to make it their own.
