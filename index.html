      <h2>About Eduba</h2>
      <p>
        Eduba takes its name from the ancient Babylonian schools where writing itself was born—spaces 
        that transformed how people learned, communicated, and built their futures. We carry that same 
        pioneering spirit forward by focusing on education first, harnessing AI not to replace teachers, 
        but to empower them.
      </p>
      <p>
        From developing easy-to-use software that streamlines everyday teaching tasks to leading 
        hands-on “Eduba Labs” that show exactly when AI adds value (and when to rely on human connection), 
        we’re redefining how classrooms evolve with technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vision is simple: give educators the support, training, and tools they need to ignite 
        student curiosity and prepare the next generation for an ever-changing world. As we refine 
        these solutions for schools, we’re laying the groundwork for bigger societal impact—because 
        when you put education at the center, everyone learns, grows, and thrives together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow us to see how we’re shaping a future where teaching, technology, and human potential 
        intersect in the best possible ways.

      <h2>Eduba Labs & Workshops</h2>
      <p>
        Our “Eduba Labs” are interactive cohorts where educators, researchers, and technologists come 
        together to explore new, practical ways of integrating AI into the classroom. It's not about 
        just learning tools—it’s about real-time collaboration, peer support, and hands-on experience.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Group Therapy Sessions:</strong> Educators share day-to-day pain points, test new 
          solutions, and learn from each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Cohort Collaboration:</strong> We collect feedback, look for standout trends or 
          anomalies, and shape our software around actual teacher needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-Time Demos:</strong> Live events and face-to-face strategy sessions let teachers 
          see—and shape—our AI tools before they reach the classroom.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By involving educators at every step, we ensure our AI-driven solutions genuinely address 
        classroom challenges and improve teaching outcomes.
