      <p class="section-text">
        EDUBA takes its name from the ancient Babylonian schools where writing was born—spaces that 
        transformed how people learned, communicated, and built their futures. We carry that pioneering 
        spirit forward by focusing on education first, harnessing AI <em>not</em> to replace teachers, 
        but to empower them. 
      </p>
      <p class="section-text">
        We’re redefining how classrooms evolve with technology, ensuring educators have the support, 
        training, and tools they need to ignite student curiosity and prepare the next generation 
        for an ever-changing world.
